Cliques Lua
-----------

Two implementations of a data clustering algorithm in Lua, one using
Object Orientation and the other Functional programming. Lua offers
many mechanisms to implement both paradigms and programming this has been
a joy and a great opportunity for learning.

It runs inside a Lua REPL shell, just:

  $ lua
  $ dofile 'cliques.lua'

From there it should tell you what to do.

There are nice implementations of some functional and OO inside techniques, worth a look!

This was made as a college homework, so here is a report
explaining it (in Brazilian portuguese): https://blog.lfzawacki.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cliques.pdf
